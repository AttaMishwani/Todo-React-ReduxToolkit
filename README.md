# Todo App with React, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, and Local Storage

This is a **Todo List Application** built using **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The app allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete or incomplete, and it persists the todo list in the browser's local storage.

You can view the live project here: [Todo-React-ReduxToolkit](https://attamishwani.github.io/Todo-React-ReduxToolkit/).

## Features

- **Add New Tasks**: Users can add tasks to the list.
- **Edit Existing Tasks**: Tasks can be edited by clicking the edit button.
- **Mark as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed or incomplete by toggling a checkbox.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks by clicking the delete button.
- **Local Storage Persistence**: All tasks are saved to local storage, ensuring that the data persists even after a page refresh.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is responsive and adjusts well to different screen sizes.

## Built With

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For managing the application's state and dispatching actions.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
- **Flowbite**: For additional prebuilt components to enhance the UI.
- **React Icons**: Used for adding icons to the application.
- **UUID**: For generating unique IDs for each task.

## File Structure

- `src/`
  - `components/`
    - **TodoContainer.js**: Contains the main structure of the app.
    - **TodoForm.js**: Handles adding tasks to the list.
    - **TodoList.js**: Renders the list of tasks.
    - **TodoItem.js**: Handles individual task functionality (edit, delete, toggle completion).
  - `store/`
    - **TodoSlice.js**: Contains Redux logic for managing tasks (add, delete, edit, toggle).
  - `App.js`: Main app component that renders the `TodoContainer`.

## State Management

The app uses **Redux Toolkit** to manage the todo state, with actions like:

- `addTodo`: Add a new todo.
- `deleteTodo`: Remove a todo from the list.
- `editTodo`: Modify the text of an existing todo.
- `toggleTodoCompletion`: Mark a todo as completed or incomplete.

## Local Storage

To ensure data persistence, the app saves and loads todos from the browser's **localStorage**:

- **loadTodosFromLocalStorage**: Loads todos from local storage on app start.
- **saveTodosToLocalStorage**: Saves the current state to local storage every time the state is updated.
